# 🛒 Store Pulse

**Store Pulse** is an end-to-end retail analytics platform that transforms raw Walmart sales data into clean, analytics-ready datasets using a modern ETL pipeline. The project is being developed as part of the OpenAI Hackathon.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Retail businesses generate massive amounts of transactional data every day. However, raw data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze directly.

Store Pulse solves this problem by:

- Extracting raw retail datasets
- Cleaning and validating the data
- Combining multiple data sources
- Loading the processed dataset into PostgreSQL
- Preparing the data for dashboards and business analytics

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a complete ETL pipeline
- Store cleaned data in PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Generate business insights through SQL
- Build interactive dashboards
- Demonstrate a real-world Data Engineering workflow

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Automated data extraction
- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing
- ✅ Missing value handling
- ✅ Duplicate removal
- ✅ Data quality checks
- ✅ Merge multiple datasets
- ✅ PostgreSQL integration
- ✅ SQL-based analytics
- ✅ Interactive Streamlit dashboard

# 🔄 ETL Workflow

## 1. Extract

Reads the following datasets:

- `train.csv`
- `stores.csv`
- `features.csv`

---

## 2. Transform

The transformation stage performs:

- Merge datasets
- Convert date formats
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Validate required fields, types, unique store keys, allowed store types, and value ranges using `Config/schema.yaml`
- Generate clean dataset

---

## 3. Load

The cleaned dataset is:

- Saved as `clean_sales.csv`
- Loaded into PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Verified after insertion

---

# 📊 Database

The cleaned data is stored inside the PostgreSQL table:

```
clean_sales
```

Main columns include:

- Store
- Department
- Date
- Weekly Sales
- Store Type
- Temperature
- Fuel Price
- CPI
- Unemployment
- Holiday Flag
- Markdown Features

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenAI-Hackathon-Team/store-pulse.git

cd store-pulse
```

---

## Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file using `.env.example`.

Example:

```env
DB_HOST=your_host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

---

## Run ETL Pipeline

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

## Run Dashboard

After the ETL has loaded `clean_sales`, activate the virtual environment and
start the Streamlit dashboard:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the Local URL printed in the terminal, usually
`http://localhost:8501`.

The dashboard uses the same `DB_*` environment variables as the ETL and reads
from the PostgreSQL `clean_sales` table. It includes:

- Date, store, department, and holiday-week filters
- Total sales, average weekly sales, active-store, and sales-record KPIs
- A weekly sales trend
- Top 10 stores and departments by total sales
- A filtered data table with CSV download

The dashboard's native dark theme is configured in `.streamlit/config.toml`.
